1. Jump high!
	* Uncomment Line 43 of SLIPParams.m, so that theta_dot and x_dot can be negative, and
          alpha = 0.
    * EvalControl_scaled.m, Line 56: change to '@Reset_S2F_Approx0',
          so that the reset map is taylor expanded around 0 (instead of -pi/6).
    * Make sure scaling and x0 are correctly defined.

2. Stay low!
	* Uncomment Line 43 of SLIPParams.m, so that theta_dot and x_dot can be negative, and
          alpha = 0.
	* EvalControl_scaled.m, Line 56: change to '@Reset_S2F_Approx0',
          so that the reset map is taylor expanded around 0 (instead of -pi/6).
    * Make sure scaling and x0 are correctly defined.

3. Run far!
    * Uncomment Line 23 of SLIPParams.m
    * EvalControl_scaled.m, Line 61: change to '@Reset_S2F_Approx'
    * Make sure scaling and x0 are correctly defined.

4. Run far, but with horizontal partition of flight phase.
    * Uncomment Line 63 of SLIPParams.m
    * EvalControl_scaled.m, Line 61: change to '@Reset_S2F_Approx'
    * Make sure scaling and x0 are correctly defined.
